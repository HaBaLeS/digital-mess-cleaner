#Image Sort & Deduplicate
This scipt scans a directory tree for images from Digital Cameras and sorts it into a new folder structure grouping it by date Year/Month. If the Target already exists a SHA256 Sum is calculated over the File to check it it is a Duplicate. Duplicates will be removed others will be renamed and moved to the other files.
